# React Best Practices

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use named exports for components

## State Management
- Use useState for local state
- Use useEffect for side effects
- Prefer composition over prop drilling
- Keep state close to where it's used

## Performance
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Use useCallback for function props
- Use useMemo for expensive calculations

## Props
- Destructure props in function signature
- Use TypeScript interfaces for prop types
- Validate props with PropTypes or TypeScript
